# Padel Scoreboard Web App

This is a Next.js web application for managing and displaying padel match scoreboards.

## Demo Credentials

A list of demo user accounts with different roles can be found in the `CREDENTIALS.md` file.

## How to Get Your Live App URL

This application is set up with Firebase App Hosting. To get a live, shareable link for your PWA, follow these steps:

1.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use the "Source Control" panel in Firebase Studio (the icon with branching lines on the left). Write a short message describing your changes (e.g., "Ready for testing") and click the **"Commit"** button.

2.  **Wait for Automatic Deployment:** As soon as you commit, the deployment process starts automatically. It will take a minute or two.

3.  **Get the URL:** Once finished, Firebase Studio will show you the **public URL** for your application in the notification area (e.g., `https://your-project-name.web.app`).

This URL is your live application. Open it in your browser to install it, and share it with your testers.

## Running in Development (Local Machine)

To run the application in development mode on your local machine, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. **This is only for testing inside Firebase Studio and does not create a shareable public link.**
