# Padel Scoreboard Web App

This is a Next.js web application for managing and displaying padel match scoreboards.

## Demo Credentials

A list of demo user accounts with different roles can be found in the `CREDENTIALS.md` file.

## Running in Development

To run the application in development mode on your local machine, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. This URL is only accessible on your computer.

## Getting a Shareable Link (Deployment)

This application is set up with Firebase App Hosting. Deployments are handled automatically by the platform when you commit and push your changes.

Inside Firebase Studio, committing your changes will trigger a new deployment. Once the deployment is complete, you will be provided with a public, shareable URL for your live application.
