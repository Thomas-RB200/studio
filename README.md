## Demo Credentials

A list of demo user accounts with different roles can be found in the `CREDENTIALS.md` file.

## Accessing Your Live App

This application is set up with Firebase App Hosting. To get a live, shareable link, follow these steps:

1.  **Commit Your Changes:** Use the "Source Control" panel in Firebase Studio to commit your work. This saves your changes and starts the deployment process.
2.  **Wait for Deployment:** The deployment will run automatically and take a minute or two.
3.  **Get the URL:** Once finished, Firebase Studio will show you the public URL for your application (e.g., `https://your-project-name.web.app`).

This URL is your live application. You can share it with your testers or use it to install the app on your devices.

## Running in Development (Local Machine)

To run the application in development mode on your local machine, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. This URL is only accessible on your computer.
