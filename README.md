## Demo Credentials

A list of demo user accounts with different roles can be found in the `CREDENTIALS.md` file.

## How to Get Your Live App URL (Guaranteed Method)

If the automatic deployment notification in Firebase Studio does not appear, you can find your URL directly in the Firebase Console. This is the most reliable method.

1.  **Go to the Firebase Console:** Open a new browser tab and navigate to [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  **Select Your Project:** Click on the Firebase project you are currently working on.
3.  **Navigate to App Hosting:** In the left-hand menu, under the "Build" section, click on **App Hosting**.
4.  **Find Your URL:** On the App Hosting page, you will see your app listed. The public URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.web.app`) will be displayed there.

This URL is your live application. Open it in your browser to install it, and share it with your testers.

## Running in Development (Local Machine)

To run the application in development mode on your local machine, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. This URL is only accessible on your computer.
