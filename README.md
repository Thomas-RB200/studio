# Padel Scoreboard Web App

This is a Next.js web application for managing and displaying padel match scoreboards.

## How to Find Your Live App URL (Guaranteed Method)

If you can't find your deployed application, follow these steps. The most common issue is being logged into the wrong Google account in the Firebase Console.

1.  **Check Your Google Account:** Open a new browser tab and go to [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/). In the **top-right corner**, click on your profile icon and **ensure you are logged in with the correct Google account** associated with this Firebase Studio project.

2.  **Select Your Project:** Once you've confirmed you are in the correct account, you will see a list of your projects. Select the one you are currently working on. If you're unsure of the name, it's often something generic like `next-js-xxxxxx`.

3.  **Navigate to App Hosting:** In the left-hand menu, under the "Build" section, click on **App Hosting**.

4.  **Find Your URL:** On the App Hosting page, you will see your app listed. The public URL (e.g., `https://your-project-name.web.app`) will be displayed there. This is your live application link.

## Demo Credentials

A list of demo user accounts with different roles can be found in the `CREDENTIALS.md` file.

## Running in Development (Local Machine)

To run the application in development mode on your local machine, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:3000`. This URL is only accessible on your computer and is not a public link.
